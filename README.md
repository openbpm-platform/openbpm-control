## Running the Tests <a name="running-the-tests"></a>

**Prerequisites:**

You must have the following installed:

1. Docker

Flowset Control tests use [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to run database and BPM engine containers.
and do not require a pre-prepared running instances for them.

To run all tests in Flowset Control, use the following command:

```shell
.\gradlew test
```

By default, all integration tests related to the BPM engine features are performed on the Camunda Run (version 7.22) which
does not have the configured authentication.
It is possible to run tests for a specific BPM engine version and authentication using the `test-engine` Spring
profile.

When the `test-engine` profile is enabled as the active profile, the following application properties become available:

1. `flowset.control.testing.engine.type` - a type of BPM engine. Supported values: `camunda_7`. Default value:
   `camunda_7`.
2. `flowset.control.testing.engine.docker-image` - the full docker image of the BPM engine. Supported
   values: [Camunda Run docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tags?name=run).
   Default value: `camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run-7.22.0`
3. `flowset.control.testing.engine.auth-type` - an authentication type for the BPM engine used in the tests. Supported values:
   `Basic`. Default value: null.

You can pass the values of these properties as environment variables or by using the `-P` prefix in the Gradle task command.

**Example 1: Run tests for Camunda Run (version 7.21)**

Using environment variable:

```shell
  SPRING_PROFILES_INCLUDE=test-engine;FLOWSET_CONTROL_TESTING_ENGINE_DOCKER_IMAGE=camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run-7.21.0 .\gradlew test
```

Using Gradle command properties:

```shell
  .\gradlew test  -Dspring.profiles.include=test-engine -Dcontrol.testing.engine.docker-image=camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run-7.21.0
```

**Example 2: Run tests for the default engine (Camunda Run 7.22) with basic authentication configured**

Using environment variable:

```shell
  SPRING_PROFILES_INCLUDE=test-engine;FLOWSET_CONTROL_TESTING_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=Basic .\gradlew test
```

Using Gradle command properties:

```shell
  .\gradlew test  -Dspring.profiles.include=test-engine -Dcontrol.testing.engine.auth-type=Basic
```
